Flashcard game project
**Winter Theme**

The game app, Landing on Landmarks, will be a matching flash card game of known landmarks in USA. It will be a 2 player game. When 2 cards matches each other, it will add points until all the cards are matches. Winner will be whoever have the most points or a tie outcome. This will be a work in progress program where I want to add more things as I learn new tools.
